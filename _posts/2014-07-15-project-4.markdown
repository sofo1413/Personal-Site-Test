description: The purpose of this project was to create a photo book that incorporated storytelling through images.  I greatly resonate with and admire the poetry of Rupi Kaur, so I decided to use her poems and take a photo that corresponded with each poem.  The story touches on many struggles including the beauty standard of society, relationships (including abusive relationships or difficult breakups) and self-discovery in a number of ways.  This project truly sparked my passion for social justice and activism and also affected the way I view storytelling as a tool for both healing and seeking truth.
