description: This is an app prototype design for a non-profit that houses abused, abandoned and neglected youth. This prototype was created to give a basic design and as a result, not all buttons are functional at this point in time.Inspiration- My mother works at a Non-Profit called the Dale House Project which aims to build relationships with at-risk youth and help them build skills for a successful life not involving toxic and criminal activities. Her involvement caused our family to quickly become passionate about the cause and because I have been studying TAM, she asked if I could design a prototype for an app that staff could use for scheduling for both themselves and the youth residents they work with.
