                    I am a developer based out of Boulder, CO graudating from the University of Colorado in December 2019.  I am a lover of stories-- telling them, hearing them, and designing them inside and out.  I operate on fun, coffee and conversations that say so little but mean so much.  I am an enneagram type 2 and a Myers Briggs ESFP (and yes, I believe that this is important and that you should think so too).  I am a leader, a learner and your biggest fan.  I hope to synthesize coding and design with my passion for telling stories to shed light on social issues and current events.

                    If you didnâ€™t want to read all of that, pretty much the bottom line is that I care a little too much about a lot of things, but I make it work.
